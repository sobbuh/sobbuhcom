Finding good freelancers can be hard. In the end, it comes down to having some knowledge of the task you want completed, for example, [app design](http://www.sobbuh.com/posts/appdesignbasics.html).  
  
When it comes to finding designers, it helps to have a good idea of what you are looking for.  
  
Here is a recent post I made  
  
Hi,  
  
I am looking for a designer to fix and complete some designs I have for an iOS app that will be related to finding vegetarian and vegan dishes/restaurants. 

I am looking for someone who has a good idea of iOS design guidelines and can help create a polished UI that is development-ready. 

I have attached my sketchapp file here that includes a rough example of some of the screens.  Your job will be to polish these screens and to create all remaining screens to make the app development-ready. 

For the first milestone, I would like someone to work on the following 3 screens (with the following user stories -- sorry for the formatting, Upwork will only let me attach one file at a time. This is just to give you an idea of the work involved.)

"Restaurant Contact Page"

Users can get directions to the restaurant (open google maps)
Users can see the restaurants phone number and call the restaurant
Users can see the restaurants address and see the restaurant on a map
Users can bookmark the restaurant
Users can favourite the restaurant
Users can share the restaurant with a friend (external application)
Users can see a link to the restaurant website and click through to the website (open in a new window)
Users can see restaurant hours
Users can see the type of food (tags) and price level of the restaurant
Users can see the top 3 most upvoted comments for a restaurant 

"People List"

As a user, I can click on the "me" button to go to my profile (or if I have a profile picture set, show that)
As a user, I can view the top people in my city (sorted by "points")
As a user, I can view the people I am currently following
As a user, I can view the people I am currently being followed by
As a user, I can see : the number of restaurants a person has rated, the number of dishes they have rated, the number of bookmarks they have, the number of favourites they have, how many followers they have, and their total points
As a user, I can see if I am currently following another user
As a user, I can follow or unfollow a user directly from the people list screen
As a user, I can click on a list item (person) on the people screen to access their user profile 

"Dishes List Screen"

As a user, I can see a list of all dishes a restaurant offers in a list view
As a user, I can choose to see only dishes that are currently available 
As a user, I can choose to only see dishes that meet my dietary preferences or to see all dishes
As a user, I can see the rating of each dish and how many reviews it has 
As a user, I can change the view to a grid view
As a user, I can favourite a dish
As a user, I can bookmark a dish
As a user, I can choose to see only my bookmarks and/or favourites
As a user, I can share a dish (external sharing)
As a user, I can comment on a dish
As a user, I can see the two most upvoted comments about a dish
As a user, I will see a notification if a dish is not currently available
As a user, I will see a notification if a dish requires a substitution or special request
As a user, I can see the name of each dish

Please let me know : 
  - your hourly rate
  - estimate the hours it will take to fix/create each of the 3 screens (this does not need to be exact, but should give me an idea of your ability to estimate time requirements) 
  - how long it will take you to complete these tasks (i.e. how many days)

Please provide : 
  - at least 2 iOS apps you have designed 
  - any other relevant design work 
  - some feedback (doesn't need to be complete -- just brief) on the current designs and what you would look to change. I just want to get a sense of your design thinking and approach

Thanks in advance for applying
