I recently was looking for a designer for an [app that I'm planning to make](http://www.sobbuh.com/posts/veg.html).  
  
It's surprisingly easy to find a good designer on upwork these days (the talent is significantly better than 2-3 years ago).    
  
Here's how I would recommend doing it:  
  
Get a solid understanding of iOS design principals -- read the [apple developer guides](https://developer.apple.com/ios/human-interface-guidelines/overview/design-principles/)  
  
Make a [description of your project](http://www.sobbuh.com/posts/prd.html).      
  
If you can create wireframes, lo-fi or high-fi mockups, that will help your cause. I recommend using [sketchapp](http://www.sobbuh.com/posts/sketch.html).  
  
Create a first milestone, and ask for a quote for the number of hours to do that.
For example, I had high-fi mockups of my app that I had made myself in sketchapp. I asked for:
a quote to re-do 3 screens
how many hours it would take to complete those 3 screens
3 examples of iOS apps they had designed in the past
The freelancer I chose was charging $50/hr, and said he could do the work in 4 hours. I interviewed him on skype, explained the app a bit, and then we moved forward with it. After that trial run, I was happy with the work so we decided on a price for the rest of the app and moved forward with that. At that point, he had a better idea of the work involved and was able to give me a quote that I felt was fair.
To give you an idea of the quality of the designs, here are a couple of before and after -- pics 1 and 3 are my mockups (#3 was an incomplete screen) and 2 and 4 are the re-designed mockups.
I hope that was of some use to you -- feel free to ask me questions. Again, I'd be more than happy to forward you his contact info, but I don't really like giving warm introductions unless I know a little about the person -- and with the quality of designers on upwork, it might make more sense to find a designer that suits your tastes.
