desc: Supplements to take as a vegetarian

Supplements I recommend taking as a vegetarian: 

[B12]()  
My dosage: 1000 mcg per day, 3-5 days a week.  
B12 is not available in large quantities in plant foods. Some cereals and nut milks are fortified with b12, but taking a supplement is generally a good idea. The body stores b12 well  

[B6]()  
My dosage:  
A b-complex vitamin is a good idea.  


[Protein Powder]()  
My dosage: 2x1.5 scoops per day  



[Potato Starch]()  
My dosage: 1 tbsp in water, each morning
