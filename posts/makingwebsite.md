This website is hosted for free on [netlify](https://www.netlify.com). It uses [roots](http://www.roots.cx) hosted on github. 

For other projects I use:    
  
[namecheap](https://www.namecheap.com/) as a domain registrar
Their website is fast and easy to use. Support is very fast. In general, it's much better than any other registrar I've used. Prices are generally the same between registrars.  
  
[domainr](http://domai.nr) to find domain names  
  
[digital ocean](http://www.digitalocean.com) for hosting
