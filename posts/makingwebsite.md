This website is hosted for free on [netlify](https://www.netlify.com). It uses [roots](http://www.roots.cx) hosted on github. This produces a static website that is quick to load and allows me to make posts through a text editor. It's okay. I might change it. Or add a CMS like contentful.  
I'm using [milligram](http://milligram.github.io) for CSS styling.
